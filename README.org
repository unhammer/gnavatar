* For users who want to override gravatar

If you want to use this instead of plain Gravatar everywhere, you can
use:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(advice-add 'gravatar-retrieve :around #'gnavatar-override)
#+end_src

For e-mails that exist in Gravatar, you'll get a result from
Gravatar. If they aren't in Gravatar, it'll try BBDB, using the
=image-uri= xfield.

Customize =gnavatar-providers= to change the priority (if you want to
try BBDB first).

* Use as library to insert avatars

The API is exactly the same as gravatar.el:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'gnavatar)
  (let ((buf (current-buffer)))
    (gnavatar-retrieve
     "a-gravatar-user@example.org"
     (lambda (i)
       (with-current-buffer buf
         (insert-image i)))))
#+end_src

If you use it like this, your end-users don't have to add any advice.

* Interactive helpers to add images to BBDB

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'gnavatar-bbdb)
  (define-key bbdb-mode-map (kbd "y") #'gnavatar-bbdb-add-clipboard-image-contents)
  (define-key bbdb-mode-map (kbd "U") #'gnavatar-bbdb-add-clipboard-image-url)
#+end_src

Now you can copy an image and hit =y= or an image url and hit =U= on
a BBDB entry and it'll fill the image-uri field with that.


If you want to show the images in BBDB:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun my-bbdb-image-size-ok (image)
    "Is IMAGE small enough?"
    (let* ((size (image-size image))
           (w (car size))
           (h (cdr size)))
      (and (< w 10) (< h 10))))

  (defun my-bbdb-maybe-insert-image (record)
    "If RECORD has an image that's small enough, insert it."
    (when-let ((image (gnavatar-bbdb-create-image record)))
      (when (my-bbdb-image-size-ok image)
        (insert " ")
        (insert-image image))))

  (advice-add #'bbdb-display-name-organization :after #'my-bbdb-maybe-insert-image)
#+end_src
